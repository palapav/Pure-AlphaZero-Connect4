playing marks in one column -> we still have moves geared towards that column
once filled -> need to check if this resolved (test)

unit testing -> statement, boundary, path, stress

Jun 15th update:
Read AlphaZero paper -> all detailed

* All changes going forward needs to be done in a branch
and merged into main

* Changes to be made

* Refactor NN so that training data and MCTS only take 2D tensors

* refactor root node -> to be owned by player one
    * wins are backpropagated to root node -> check with pure MCTS

* refactor optimal z score in backpropagation and training data -> total z score / total visits

# np.random.choice for root policy vector 

* stop illegal moves in eval mode

* to test mcts using untrained neural network -> 3 in a row -> can we get to 4

# cross entropy -> zero sum property

# check whether policy and chosen actions are lining up index wise

* total z value / total visits

* temperature parameter -> take all probabiltiies and raise to one over temperature power
if temperature is very high -> policy very explorative

* refactor out for loops

* print board states, policy states, and values

* add regularization to loss function

* casting to double in loss function -> see if there is a better way
